# Smart Irrigation System

## Problem Statement

- In traditional irrigation systems, water saving is not considered
- Plants undergo high stress from variation in soil moisture
- Absence of automatic controlling system results in improper water control
- Growing population increases water demand
- Emerging global water crisis makes water management critical
- Water shortage particularly affects economically poor countries
- Requires automatic system to optimize water usage in agriculture

## Proposed Solution

- Smart Irrigation System based on Arduino microcontroller
- Monitors soil moisture content automatically
- Uses predefined moisture values that can be adjusted for different crops
- Automatic ON/OFF control of watering system
- Implements PROTEUS software with C programming
- Scalable for large farming applications
- Helps conserve water through optimal irrigation scheduling

## Methodology

- Dual sensor node system implementation:
  - Image sensor for crop monitoring
  - Environmental parameter collector
- Base station data collection
- Web application integration
- Server-side data analysis
- GPRS/CDMA duplex communication
- RF transceiver for inter-node communication
- Successfully tested in Beijing, Henan and Shandong Province
